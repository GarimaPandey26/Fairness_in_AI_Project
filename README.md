# Fairness_in_AI_Project
Overview This project focuses on detecting and mitigating bias in machine learning using the AIF360 library on real-world datasets: Medical Expenditure Dataset Adult Income Dataset German Credit Dataset

The project demonstrates bias detection, visualization, and mitigation using: Reweighing (Pre-processing) Prejudice Remover (In-processing) Reject Option Classification (Post-processing)

Tech Stack Python Pandas, NumPy Scikit-learn AIF360 Matplotlib

Features Load and preprocess datasets for fairness analysis. Evaluate fairness metrics: Statistical Parity Difference (SPD) Disparate Impact (DI) Equal Opportunity Difference (EOD) Average Odds Difference (AOD) Apply mitigation techniques and compare metrics before and after mitigation. Visualize fairness improvement using bar charts.
